# GrpcDemo
A look at the different type of gRPC types available: Unary, Server streaming, Client streaming, Bi-directional streaming

gRPC can be used for interprocess communication such as comms between microservices.
Here a grpc server talks to a server side blazor service.  
(Blazor WASM has to use gRPC-Web and is limited due to being inside the browser sandbow)
